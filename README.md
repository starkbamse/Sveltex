# Sveltex - A fast replacement to your current CMS.

## Introduction
Welcome to Sveltex, a state-of-the-art content management system (CMS), a **WordPress** replacement, built with the powerful and efficient Svelte frontend framework and the robust and performant Rust programming language. Svelte offers an innovative approach to building user interfaces while Rust provides unparalleled control over system resources, making them a perfect combo for building fast, efficient and secure web applications.

Our main goal is to provide an easy, flexible and efficient way to manage web content, without compromising on speed, security, and performance.

## Features
1. **Ease Of Use:** A fast, simple and intuitive UI, thanks to Svelte.
2. **Performance:** Optimal speed and efficiency gained using Rust at the backend. 
3. **Security:** Rust's safety assurances, like memory safety without garbage collection, makes our CMS robust and secure.
4. **Scalability:** Ability to handle large amounts of content efficiently.
5. **Moderation Tools:** Enables easy management and control of web content.

## How Does It Work?
1. **Content Creation:** Users create different types of content through the frontend UI.
2. **Content Storage:** The created content is sent to the Rust backend, where it is processed and stored in an SQL database.
3. **Content Retrieval:** When the content needs to be displayed, it is retrieved from the backend, processed and sent to the frontend.
4. **Content Presentation:** The frontend receives the content, processes it and displays it to the end-users in an efficient manner.
